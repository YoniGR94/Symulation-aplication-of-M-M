### 🍫🍬 M&M Package Simulation

🔴🟡🟠🟢🔵🟤

This repository contains a data simulation of M&M packages, analyzing the distribution of colors and various statistical properties.

The goal is to explore simulation creation and identify potential biases or anomalies.

Look for the result here:

[Presentation PDF](https://github.com/YoniGR94/Symulation-aplication-of-M-M/blob/main/MnM-sampling-report.pdf)

[RMD code file](https://github.com/YoniGR94/Symulation-aplication-of-M-M/blob/main/MnM-sampling-report.Rmd)

For now, you can see the result: Probability of all colors of snack package be in couples by size of package and number of colors:

### 📂 What’s Inside?

✅ Simulated M&M packages with different color distributions

✅ Statistical analysis (mean, variance, hypothesis testing)

✅ visualizations to highlight trends

✅ The interesting Question: can you eat each color two by two all the way to the end?


Here is the distribution of each color of M&M from my simulation

### 🔍 Key Questions Explored

1. How evenly does colors distributed in an M&M package?

2. What is the probability of getting too little of one color?

3. Do different package sizes affect color variation?

### 📚 required libraries

Clone the repository and run the analysis using the Tidyverse and visualization using ggplot.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)
library(scales)
```

### 🔧 AI

I use approximately 15% AI prompt for these tasks:

1. Error on cloning and function output

2. Automation of simple functions and plots

3. Peer review
