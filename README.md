### 🍫🍬 M&M Package Simulation

🔴🟡🟠🟢🔵🟤


This repository contains a data simulation of M&M packages, analyzing the distribution of colors and various statistical properties.

The goal is to explore simulation creation and identify potential biases or anomalies.


### 📂 What’s Inside?

✅ Simulated M&M packages with different color distributions

✅ Statistical analysis (mean, variance, hypothesis testing)

✅ visualizations to highlight trends

✅ The interesting Question: can you eat each color two by two all the way to the end?


### 🔍 Key Questions Explored

1. How evenly does colors distributed in an M&M package?

2. What is the probability of getting less than half of a certain color?

3. Do different package sizes affect color variation?

4. Are there significant deviations from expected randomness?

Clone the repository and run the analysis using R and ggplot2.

### 📚 required libraries
